## Adapter Pattern

Adapter Pattern is used to convert an interface object to another interface object.


In this example we wrote a Adapter name EnumerationAdapter which converts an Enumeration object to Iterator object. Here Iterator is Target object and Enumeration is Adaptee object. Adapter is developed by using interface implementation over Target and composition over Adaptee.

Adapter Pattern's formal definition is - 

The Adapter Patern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
