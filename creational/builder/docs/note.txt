Problem Type:
- when a object creation is in multiple steps
- when a object creation has lots of options (firstName, lastName, age - property variations for User class)
- we can use getter method to set specific properties. But getter method does not return the changed object. So setting multiple properties will be complicated. If a builder is used, setting multiple properties is easier.
- The builder class almost doubled up the line of code. But it adds design flexibility and readability. The objects contructor is simplified.
- This pattern will be useful for a class with many optionated parameters.
